# SOC Incident Investigations — Network Threat Analysis Lab
### Overview

This repository contains a series of hands-on SOC-style incident investigations conducted in a controlled lab environment. Each incident focuses on a distinct category of network activity commonly encountered by Security Operations Center analysts, progressing from baseline protocol validation to active reconnaissance and covert communication techniques.

The investigations emphasize:

Evidence-driven analysis

Protocol-level validation

Clear scoping and classification

Practical response recommendations

All incidents were captured at the network level and analyzed using packet capture and Zeek, with supporting artifacts and screenshots included for transparency and reproducibility.

Lab Environment

Network Sensor: Zeek (Ubuntu)

Packet Capture: tcpdump

Analysis Framework: Zeek (conn.log, protocol-specific logs)

Attacker / Simulator: Kali Linux (192.168.94.136)

Victim Hosts: Windows and Linux systems

DNS Resolver / Gateway: 192.168.94.2 (VMware NAT)

The same host (192.168.94.136) is intentionally reused across multiple incidents to demonstrate progression from reconnaissance to more advanced malicious behavior.

Incident Summary
Incident 001 — UDP / NTP Traffic Validation

Category: Baseline Protocol Analysis

This investigation validates legitimate outbound Network Time Protocol (NTP) traffic generated by a Windows host. The incident establishes a clean baseline for UDP behavior and demonstrates protocol-level confirmation using both connection metadata and NTP-specific Zeek logs.

Key skills demonstrated:

Packet capture integrity

UDP protocol validation

Baseline vs anomaly reasoning

Incident 002 — TCP Port Scanning with Service Detection

Category: Reconnaissance

This incident documents the detection and analysis of a TCP SYN-based port scan with service/version probing. Network telemetry reveals a one-to-many connection pattern originating from a single internal host, consistent with horizontal scanning activity.

Service probing artifacts observed in multiple Zeek protocol logs corroborate active reconnaissance behavior.

Key skills demonstrated:

Detection of scan patterns via connection metadata

Differentiation between scan traffic and background noise

Correlation of attacker tooling with passive network evidence

Incident 003 — DNS Tunneling (Flagship Investigation)

Category: Covert Command-and-Control / Data Exfiltration

This flagship investigation analyzes anomalous DNS activity characterized by long, high-entropy subdomains and sustained query frequency from a single internal host. The traffic is explicitly validated as unicast DNS over UDP/53 and ruled out as multicast name resolution (mDNS/LLMNR).

Behavioral indicators strongly align with DNS tunneling used for covert command-and-control or data exfiltration.

Key skills demonstrated:

Transport-layer validation (DNS vs mDNS/LLMNR)

High-entropy query analysis

Behavioral detection and host attribution

SOC-style classification and response planning

Methodology

Each investigation follows a consistent SOC-aligned workflow:

Traffic capture using tcpdump at the network sensor

Parsing and enrichment using Zeek

Evidence validation through protocol and behavioral analysis

Scoping and classification based on observed indicators

Response recommendations aligned with real SOC procedures

Screenshots are included selectively to support analytical claims rather than replace narrative explanation.
